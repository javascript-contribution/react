# react-template-components
react-template-components will have templates for all javascript users and contributors. Anyone who wants to refer the work or code for their future projects, can do that by just cloning or downloading zip files. This will be shared work with all contributors. Github could be used as a common platform for depositing individual’s valuable input on any framework or mostly into js dependencies libraries. 
# Process to be followed:
Clone the public or private srijan depository
Give access to all individual contributors or keep it public
Use rebase technique on the feature branch for avoiding community code disputes
Individual contributor can’t do his own code review (Peer contributor could do that or their could be fixed chronological orders to assign code reviews)
Once code review is completed, merging and closing of feature branch must be done.
Each js library or dependencies must use its own name for the file which deposit work unto GitHub (eg. While using react-hook-form, peer contributor must name such as reactHookForm.js )
Test file/ code template could also be written for each push or could contribute to the peer contributor’s work
 Also documentation of intallation of npm or yarn for each individual dependencies could be shown on the readMe file
Also show links of other documentation and sandbox of each work on the readme file, if possible
Use comments for each javascript file, if seemed important.
If anyone wants to create a customized code as in form of plugins, then could contribute here and later push work another repository to publish plugins as per motives.
Keep all new stack or library or dependencies as separate files as possible, to yield maximum code reusability .  
=> Contributing Guidelines for js are described in more detailed below, could be used:
https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Javascript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
=> Here is the example for js contributions done by multiple collaborators with single motive : https://github.com/atom/atom
=> To proceed ahead, someone from HR or js contributor must make an new GitHub repository which is free unless using full fledge features or tools such as Continous integration, etc..
